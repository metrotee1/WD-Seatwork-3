## Overview

This project, which features multiple pages, effects, and container manipulations, was made to experiment with different Header and Footer iterations while showcasing our HTML and CSS talents. It has a landing page with a title, description, subtitle, and two buttons that take us to two separate pages: one with five examples of animated and five examples of static headers, and another with five instances of static and animated footers.

### Key Components
  - Landing Page
  - Headers Page
  - Footers Page
  - Different coding skills

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|       └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
